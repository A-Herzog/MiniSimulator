<h3>More simulators</h3>
-->

<p>
This simulator is completely implemented in <b>Javascript</b>. This has the advantage that it can be executed directly in the browser without the need for a software installation. However, this also limits the modeling possibilities and also the execution speed. For more complex models, there are three desktop programs available as opensource:

  <p class="card-text">
  Warteschlangensimulator allows the simulation of arbitrary, complex queue networks. The models are defined in Warteschlangensimulator in the form of <b>flow charts</b>. Optionally, an <b>animation</b> illustrating the movement of clients through the system can be displayed during the simulation of the model. Parameter series can be automatically created for automated examination of different models, and an optimizer is also available. Furthermore, external data sources can be directly connected during the simulation of models and also (partial) results can be directly transferred to external programs (e.g. databases).

  <p class="card-text">
  Callcenter Simulator is designed to represent <b>real call center systems</b> consisting of multiple sub-call centers, different caller groups, different agent groups (with different skill levels and different shift schedules), complex routing rules, etc. It can be used directly for staffing requirements planning and for analyzing possible control strategies in large call center networks. Beyond pure simulation, the program also provides functions for automatic optimization of the number of agents per time interval.

  Mini Callcenter Simulator essentially replicates the same <b>G/G/c/K+G model</b> that this simulator features. However, it has many more probability distributions that can be used for inter-arrival, service time, post-processing time, waiting time tolerance, and retry distance distributions. Also, many more characteristics are recorded and various export options are available for the simulation results. Furthermore, the simulation results can be directly be compared with corresponding <b>Erlang-C</b> results and explanations can be displayed as to why deviations occur at which points.

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
All three simulators are implemented in <b>Java</b>, which means that a <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java runtime environment</a> is required for execution. The simulators are available as <b>open source</b> free of charge for arbitrary applications. All simulators can use multiple CPU cores and are fully available in German and in Englishuf Englisch verf√ºgbar.

In addition, <a href="https://a-herzog.github.io/MiniWarteschlangensimulator" target="_blank"><b>Mini Warteschlangensimulator</b></a>, a simulator implemented in Javascript, is offered that enables the modeling of queue models in the form of flowcharts, similar to the desktop program <a href="https://a-herzog.github.io/Warteschlangensimulator" target="_blank">Warteschlangensimulator</a>. However, the modeling capabilities and also the statistical records are significantly limited compared to the desktop solution.
